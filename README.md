# secure-bot
Smart surveillance using telegram chatbot using the combination of face recognition and motion detection.

Objective:

An affordable home security system using Telegram chatbot.
Uses Face recognition algorithm along with Motion detection to give correct intrusion alerts
Sends out intrusion alert with picture when unknown person enters frame.
User can request surveillance footage through commands.
The system alerts user when it canâ€™t detect a face but there is movements.


Problem Statement:

Smart home security is very expensive to set up.
Existing system uses motion detection alone which produces false alerts.
A subscription amount is necessary for storage of surveillance footage.
Our system uses motion detection and face recognition to filter out false results.
Surveillance footage is stored in telegram server free of cost.
Cost effective to set up.


Literature Survey:

The literature on CNN for image recognition by Samer Hijazi summarises:
        1.CNN gives best performance in pattern/image	 	recognition.
        2.Training time is proportionally reduced since 	 	parameters are reduced.
The paper by Rupesh Kumar Rout on Object detection and tracking discusses the different methods of motion detection like:
	1.Frame differencing
	2.Background subtraction
The literature by Soo Kuo Yang on Human motion detection system describes:
	1.A method to detect motion detected in a video and classify if it is a human or not.
	2.This system uses background subtraction.
	3.Head to foot of a person should be available in frame in order for it to classify as human
	4.Not ideal
